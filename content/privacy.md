Welcome to Simpleminded Robot. We deeply value your privacy and are committed to protecting any personal information you share with us. This Privacy Policy is put in place with the best intentions to ensure transparency and safeguard your privacy rights.

We believe that privacy is a fundamental right, and we strive to minimize data collection and processing to only what is necessary for providing you with a great user experience. Our goal is to be clear and honest about our practices, ensuring you have control over your information.

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you interact with our blog. We encourage you to read this policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your information and how we will treat it.

## Information We Collect

While we don't collect personal information directly, some third-party services and functionalities we use may process or store data:

2. Cloudflare Insights: For web traffic analysis
3. Google Fonts: For website styling
4. FlexSearch: For on-site search functionality

## Comment System

We use [giscus](https://giscus.app), a lightweight comments widget built on GitHub issues. Here's what you need to know:

1. To comment, you need a GitHub account.
2. Your comments will be stored as GitHub discussions.
3. All comments are subject to moderation.
4. We will not use your GitHub information for any purpose other than responding to comments.
5. The use of GitHub Issues and GitHub accounts is subject to GitHub's terms and conditions, not those of Simpleminded Robot.

## Data Processing and Storage

1. We don't collect any data directly, so we have nothing to retain.
2. Comments are stored in GitHub Issues and are subject to GitHub's data retention policies.
3. Web traffic data collected by Cloudflare Insights is subject to their data retention policies.
4. FlexSearch processes search queries client-side (in your browser) and may store a search index in your browser's local storage. This data does not leave your device and is not accessible to us.
