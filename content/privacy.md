## Introduction

Welcome to Simpleminded Robot. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting any personal information you share with us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you interact with our blog.

We use utteranc.es, a lightweight comments widget built on GitHub issues. Here's what you need to know:

1. To comment, you need a GitHub account.

5. The use of GitHub Issues and GitHub accounts is subject to GitHub's terms and conditions, not those of Simpleminded Robot.

We don't collect any data directly, so we have nothing to retain. However:
- Comments are stored in GitHub Issues and are subject to GitHub's data retention policies.
